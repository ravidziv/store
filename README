The store application -

This app Simulates a store webside that allows to order Products.
In this project i stores all the data on apache server that support mysql and php (I used wamp) .

When you want to run the app you need to run first the createTheDB.php file that create the 
DB, and tables and load to them the Products that stores in data/items.json.

The createTheDB.php Connects to the server with the username - "root", the server name "localhost", 
and the passwprd is - "".

After that you jost need to run the index.html file.
This file using the store.js javascript file.
This js file have one basic modele - the Product.
it represents one type of Product in our store.
Also we have the item model that represents the ordered Product.

Also we have two collections that represent a serveal of models (on for each model),
and we have also a view for each model and collection, and a view that wrapper the all app.

The DataBasedObject.php is a file that contains an object that create connection to the Server, creates 
the dataBase, creates tables and inseres them the Initial values.

The index.php file managers all the request that came from the client side.
It contains two object, one to stores the data and the second one to make the 
actions (Insert in our case).

The getCatalog.php is a file taht loads all the data from the server and converts it to json format.
